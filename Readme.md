This work is an exercise on implementing a graph in Python, using an adjacency list representation, implemented with dictionaries.

To check the results, have a look at the [Jupyter Notebook](Graphs-Lesson8.ipynb)

The tests are inconsistent, due to my lack of experience, but I feel like I am improving.

Comments and hints are welcomed. Feel free to ask questions by creating issues.

If you want to install a Jupyter notebook editor, just install anaconda navigator.
